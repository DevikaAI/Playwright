I went with Kaspersky because I heard it would be light on my resources. I thought I might sacrifice some protection – but this was not the case!

I feel like I get just as much if not more protection than any competitors offer. All while running very quietly in the background.

My husband and I have used Kaspersky for a couple of years now. We are both big-time gamers and this is the only product we've found that doesn't mess with our World of Warcraft play. It’s the absolute best!

Tried other products and always went back to Kaspersky. Solid products, lightweight, intuitive UI. Have it on multiple devices in my family, including teenagers, and never had any systems compromised.
